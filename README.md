### Integration Mockup

A simple React + Tailwind prototype demonstrating integration with the Integration API. This project shows how to send a customer session payload and display both the payload and cart items as visually appealing cards.

#### ðŸ“Œ Features

-   Sends a static payload to /v2/customer_sessions endpoint (mock/demo).
-   Displays customer session payload in a clean, readable format.
-   Renders each cart item as its own Tailwind card, showing:
    -   Product name
    -   SKU
    -   Quantity
    -   Price and total cost
-   Styled with Tailwind CSS.
-   Can be expanded to show API responses, loyalty points, or applied discounts.
